# Building a Large Language Model from Scratch

This project implements a basic transformer-based language model from scratch.

## Components
1. Tokenization
2. Embedding Layer
3. Positional Encoding
4. Self-Attention
5. Transformer Block
6. Full Language Model

## Usage
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Train model: `python train.py`
3. Run predictions: `python predict.py`

## Installation
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd llm-from-scratch
pip install -r requirements.txt
